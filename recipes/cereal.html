    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Listen, don't get me started about this freaking cereal. I got the willies when I even touched my spoon to the surface of the freaking milk.</p>
    <p>Hey, if you want to eat it, that's your business. I feel like I'd be doing something nasty, you know? Like violating it. If I were you I'd just make this one and let it get soggy and pour it out.</p>

        <li>Cereal of your choice (e.g. Lucky Charms)</li>
